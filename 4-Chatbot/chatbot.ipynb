Actively listen to her responses.\\n* **Be playful and build on the existing chemistry:**  You mentioned banter, so keep that going!  Remember inside jokes or funny moments you shared in the past. \\n* **Express excitement about her offer to cook:** \"I\\'m so excited about the cooking offer! What are you thinking of making?\" This shows you value her offer and are looking forward to spending time with her.\\n* **Be consistent and respectful:** Don\\'t disappear again! Be present and engaged in your conversations.\\n\\nRemember, building a genuine connection takes time and effort.  Focus on being a good listener, showing interest in her, and letting your true self shine through. \\n\\n**Bonus tip:** If you\\'re feeling nervous, a little self-deprecating humor can go a long way.
